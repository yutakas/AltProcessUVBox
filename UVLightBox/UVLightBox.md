I did not have any idea at first, either. In fact, there are few information in internet. But I found this page was super helpful (though I don’t think I understand it completely).

This does not talk much about LED black light but I noticed the wavelength can be covered. I was not sure but I decided to try it. I did not want to use HID or fluorescent tubes. I did not want to do soldering bare LED lights. So I searched amazon some lights and ordered two sets of https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071NT6189/. One set came with 4 2ft LED bars and it looked easy to install with the accessory. I received 8 LED bars.
I put them on a wood photo frame and connected them as follows.

That’s it. I put this on two 1-foot-height cardboard boxes and tested it. Cyanotype worked!! It worked well in my living room with closed blind even sunny day time. I could get consistent max black and curve with this simple dumb setting on day or night time. I played this setting for several times and liked it.
Actually I did not have a plan to have a wood box first because a room with closed blind worked well for cyanotype.
But the problem was that it was so bright during exposing and I did not like the weird violet light shined entire room.

In a memorial day weekend, I stopped by HomeDepot and picked up cheap woods, ¼ inch-thick 2’-by-4’ boards and a few long ¾inch-by-1inch. HomeDepot guy cut boards to me. The box size is 20”x30”x12” and the front door is 30”x6”.

I tried VDB this weekend the max black was 5 min. The light may be too strong for VDB. I’m going to try 4 or 6 LED bars instead of 8 LED bars. The top is not glued and it is screwed with only four screws. I can easily replace and adjust the light.
